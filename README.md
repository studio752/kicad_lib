## LED_RGB_0606_QTB
PCB footprint for a QT Brightek common anode RGB LED in an 0606 package. Note that RGB LED pinouts are not standard between manufacturers. A standard 0603 LED is referenced and scaled for the 3D model.

## L_Bourns-SRR4028
PCB footprint for a Bourns SRR4028 4.8 mm square shielded inductor. The arc in the manufacturer's recommended pad has been simplified to a polygon. An existing SRR1260 inductor is referenced and scaled for the 3D model.

## Potentiometer_Bourns_TC33X_Vertical
PCB footprint for a Bourns TC33X 3.8 mm x 3.6 mm trimmer potentiometer. An existing 3314G potentiometer is referenced and scaled for the 3D model.
